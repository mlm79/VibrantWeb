## The Vibrant Web

A Chrome plug-in for mining and visualizing 3rd-party entities on the web.

### How it works
From the downloads page, download the ctx file, and open it in Chrome.

Chrome will ask your permission to install, and inform you that the plug-in has access to all your browsing data.  This is correct.
However, the extension does not make visible any of your browsing data outside your computer.  No data is sent to any outside service.  All browsing data is stored in localStorage in background.html, a page within your extension.
